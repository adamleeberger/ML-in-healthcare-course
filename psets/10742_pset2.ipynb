However, classic ML model metrics (e.g. AUROC) don't capture this aspect – a model that predicts sepsis correctly 8 hours in advance of sepsis onset is equivalent in quality to a model that predicts it 3 hours in advance. Describe, in a few sentences, a proposed metric that takes both accuracy and timeliness into account. Describe how you would modify your approach to build a model that optimizes this metric, vs. traditional AUC."
